# Fitting regression models

## Least squares, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference

### Least squares

### Estimation of residual standard deviation $\sigma$

### Computing the sum of squares directly

### Maximum likelihood

### Where do the standard errors come from? Using the likelihood surface to assess uncertainty in the parameter estimates

### Bayesian inference

### Point estimate, mode-based approximation, and posterior simulations

## Influence of individual points in a fitted regression

## Least squares slope as a weighted average of slopes of pairs

## Comparing two fitting functions: lm and stan_glm

### Reproducing maximum likelihood using stan_glm with flat priors and optimization

### Running lm

### Confidence intervals, uncertainty intervals, compatibility intervals
