# Linear regression with a single predictor

## Example: predicting presidential vote share from the economy

### Fitting a linear model to data

### Understanding the fitted model

### Graphing the fitted regression line

### Using the model to predict

## Checking the model-fitting procedure using fake-data simulation

### Step 1: Creating the pretend world

### Step 2: Simulating fake data

### Step 3: Fitting the model and comparing fitted to assumed values

### Step 4: Embedding the simulation in a loop

## Formulating comparisons as regression models

### Estimating the mean is the same as regressing on a constant term

### Estimating a difference is the same as regressing on an indicator variable
