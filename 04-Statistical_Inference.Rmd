# Statistical Inference

## Sampling distributions and generative models

### Sampling, measurement error, and model error

### The sampling distribution

## Estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals

### Parameters, estimands, and estimates

### Standard errors, inferential uncertainty, and confidence intervals

### Standard errors and confidence intervals for average and proportions

### Standard error and confidence interval for a proportion when $y = 0$ or $y = n$

### Standard error for a comparison

### Sampling distribution of the sample mean and standard deviation; normal and $\chi^2$ distributions

### Degrees of freedom

### Confidence intervals from the $t$ distribution

### Inference for discrete data

### Linear transformations

### Comparisons, visual and numerical

### Weighted averages

## Bias and unmodeled uncertainty

### Bias in estimation

### Adjusting inferences to account for bias and unmodeled uncertainty

## Statistical significance, hypothesis testing, and statistical errors

### Statistical significance

### Hypothesis testing for simple comparisons

#### Estimate, standard error, and degrees of freedom

#### Null and alternative hypotheses

### Hypothesis testing: general formulation

### Comparisons of parameters to fixed values and each other: interpreting confidence intervals as hypothesis tests

### Type 1 and type 2 errors and why we don’t like talking about them

### Type M (magnitude) and type S (sign) errors

### Hypothesis testing and statistical practice

## Problems with the concept of statistical significance

### Statistical significance is not the same as practical importance

### Non-significance is not the same as zero

### The difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant

### Researcher degrees of freedom, $p$-hacking, and forking paths

### The statistical significance filter

### Example: A flawed study of ovulation and political attitudes

## Example of hypothesis testing: 55,000 residents need your help!
